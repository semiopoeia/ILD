In this repository are examples of wrangling and analyzing data coming from Intensive Longitudinal Data designs. In some cases we are borrowing data from the designs but the analysis isn't exactly embracing the intensive longitudinal nature. Data is perturbed or otherwise excluded for security related to protections of the originating studies.
